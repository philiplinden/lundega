The “tableland-bound” database allows permissioning by way of NFTs. Since the
database is run on an IPFS node, the access permissions to update the database
is managed by onchain Ethereum permissions using Tableland, where some columns
for the entry are self-attested by the robot, and various credential bodies can
submit their schema for credentials.
